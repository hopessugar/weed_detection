# **Soybean Weed Detection Model**

## **Overview**
This project involves the detection and classification of soybean field components using a lightweight deep learning model based on **MobileNetV2**. 
The model identifies four classes: **Soybean**, **Soil**, **Broadleaf**, and **Weed**, and groups them into two categories:

- **Category 1 (Non-Weeds):** Soil, Soybean, Broadleaf  
- **Category 2 (Weeds):** Weed  

The aim is to assist farmers in managing weeds effectively and improving crop yields through precise identification.

## **Key Features**
- **Lightweight Model:** Built using MobileNetV2, ensuring efficient performance and deployment on resource-constrained devices.
- **Multi-Class Classification:** Accurately differentiates between field components and weeds.
- **Data Augmentation:** Preprocessed dataset with techniques to improve model robustness against variations in field conditions.
- **Deployment-Ready:** Optimized for real-time applications, such as drones or automated sprayers.

## **How It Works**
1. **Input:** Field images are fed into the model.
2. **Processing:** The model classifies the input image into one of the four classes.
3. **Output:** Results guide weed management decisions, such as precision spraying.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Model Architecture:** MobileNetV2
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Preprocessing Tools:** OpenCV for image resizing and augmentation.
